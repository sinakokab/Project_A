# Client_Project_A

Full stack web application made for a client (01/07/20 - 01/09/20).

Note - Some areas i.e. question data/questionbank data etc have been removed.

Languages:
  * JS with Jquery for front end.
  * Python with Flask for back end.
  * Docker framework to combine front/backend on one server.
  * Shell application for SSL certificate generation + auto renewal.
  
Functionality:
  * Syncs stripe customers and allows them to login to their respective portals depending on the package purchased.
  * Quiz applications with flagging, notepad, calculator and review incomplete questions functions.
  * Easy deployment with Docker, alongside auto restarting in the case of an application crash or server downtime.
  
Improvements:
  * Add functionality for automatic deployment without technical know-how.
  * Change framework from Jquery to something modular i.e. React/Angular
  * DRY with code, could've been far shorter and more efficient.
